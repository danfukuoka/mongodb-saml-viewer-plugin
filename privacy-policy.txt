MongoDB SAML Response Viewer does not collect, store, or transmit any data. This Privacy Policy explains how it works.

2. Information We Collect

Our extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It operates entirely on the user's device and only displays the SAML response for debugging purposes.

- The extension processes SAML responses locally to help users debug federated authentication in MongoDB.
- No data is stored permanently or transmitted to any external server.

We do not share, sell, or rent any user data. Since our extension does not store or transmit data, there is no risk of unauthorized disclosure.

5. Data Retention and Security

- Any captured SAML response is stored temporarily in the user's browser memory and is cleared upon closing the extension or browser.
- We do not retain any user data beyond the active session.

6. Third-Party Services

This extension does not interact with third-party services, APIs, or external servers. It functions entirely within the user's local browser environment.

7. Your Choices

Users have full control over their SAML responses. Since no data is stored or transmitted, there are no privacy risks associated with the use of this extension.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected in an updated version with a new effective date.
